# RetainAI

Predict which customers may leave (churn). Act instantly. Bring them back

---

## Overview

RetainAI is a prototype system that identifies customers at risk of churn, diagnoses why they are disengaging, and automatically triggers targeted recovery actions to help them succeed before they leave.

Most companies detect churn only after the customer is already gone. RetainAI focuses on early detection and automated recovery — guiding customers back to value instead of just measuring churn.

---

## Problem

Customer churn is often silent and reactive.  
Users usually leave because they fail to achieve their intended outcome — not because they suddenly decide to quit.

Companies:

- Detect churn too late  
- Lack automated recovery systems  
- Rely on dashboards instead of action  

---

## Solution

RetainAI:

1. Monitors engagement signals  
2. Detects early churn risk  
3. Diagnoses likely cause of disengagement  
4. Automatically triggers targeted recovery  

**Goal:** Help customers succeed before they leave.

## Prototype Features

- Customer risk dashboard  
- Churn risk detection (rule-based prototype)  
- Reason-based disengagement diagnosis  
- Automated recovery workflow  
- Simulated adaptive retention system  

---

## Why This Matters

Small improvements in retention significantly increase revenue and customer lifetime value.  
Yet most tools focus on analytics instead of automated recovery.

RetainAI explores a shift from **reactive churn handling → continuous autonomous customer recovery**.

---

## Current Status

This is an early prototype built to validate:

- Early churn detection  
- Cause-based recovery  
- Automated intervention workflow  

Next step: integrating adaptive AI-driven prediction and recovery optimization.

---

## Target Users

Initially:

- SaaS companies  
- Subscription-based businesses  

Long term:

Any company where retention and customer success drive growth.

---

## Vision

In the future, companies won’t manually manage retention.

Autonomous systems will continuously monitor engagement, diagnose problems, and help customers succeed — improving retention and customer outcomes automatically.

RetainAI aims to become that system.
